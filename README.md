## Description

The Website Blocker Chrome Extension is a powerful tool designed to enhance productivity by blocking distracting websites such as social media platforms, games, and other attention-seeking apps. This extension serves as a reminder to stay focused on your work or other important tasks by making it more inconvenient to access these distracting websites.

This extension does not rely solely on willpower, as it acknowledges that complete prevention may not always be feasible. Instead, it provides an additional layer of inconvenience, giving you the opportunity to reconsider accessing the distractions and reminding you of your commitment to developing better habits. Over time, this small inconvenience can lead to more consistent and productive behavior.

The extension adds a filter on the URL and if it has the specified word in the URL then it will block it. EX: If you add the word "chess" in the extension then it will block sites like "chess.com" but also google searches for "chess"
